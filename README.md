# Rock-paper-scissor Implementation
Python implementation of classic Rock Paper and Scissor game

# Things I learnt from the project

1. I understood and learnt how to conceptualize and structure the python program
2. I consolidated my knowledge about control flows and function creation
3. I understood how run a python program with separate moving pieces on a terminal


# Additional Things to do
1. Use classes in the implementation
2. Use some kind of web frontend to enhance the look and feel of the game 


# Additional Update
1. Below changes are done in the program:

1.1 Additional variables to control the Name of the computer opponent, Total Wins etc are added

1.2 Functions optimized. Now each function is supposed to do just one thing

1.3 Print statements removed from the function. They will be treated separately

1.4 Sleep variable added to better the game flow. Using time import

1.5 Logic changed for ultimate winner declaration. Now the game will go on untill either of the players Wins per variable declaration(Total_Wins)

1.6 The game now prints the count of total wins for both players and draw between the players
